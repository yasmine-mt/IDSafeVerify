# IDSafeVerify
This project implements a web application using Flask and OpenCV for processing identity documents (ID cards) and performing facial recognition tasks. It allows users to upload images of ID card fronts and backs, extracts information using MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) detection, and saves the documents securely.
